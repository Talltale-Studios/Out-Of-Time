# Out-Of-Time
The game will be a roguelite metroidvania game. Its mechanics and level design will be heavily inspired by the likes of games such as Enter The Gungeon, The Binding Of Isaac, Neon Abyss, Exit The Gungeon, Dead Cells, and Have A Nice Death.

The "overworld" will feature pre-built set pieces that are procedurally fit together to form expansive levels. For inspiration, look at Dead Cells or Have A Nice Death.

The "underworld", or the "dungeons", will feature prebuilt rooms, with doors that lock during fights, that are procedurally fit together. For inspiration, look at Neon Abyss or Exit the Gungeon, which were in turn inspired by Enter The Gungeon and The Binding Of Isaac.

There will be several biomes, each having a visually distinct theme and featuring unique overworld set pieces, dungeon rooms, enemies, traps and challenges. The currently planned biomes include the following: Summer, Magical, Autumn, Winter, and Tropical. Within each biome there will also be several areas, each being slightly different in terms of visuals, set pieces, dungeon rooms, enemies, traps and challenges.

For example, the Summer biome could have a Grasslands area, a Forest area, and a Valley area. The Summer Grasslands level will feature hilly terrain with small encampments strewn about. The Summer Forest area will feature some rivers, cliffs, and lots of trees. The Summer Valley area will feature a lot more verticality and cliffs.

While there is loot in the overworld, the dungeons will be the player's main source of loot, and sometimes the player will be forced to go into the dungeons to bypass certain obstacles in the overworld, or to obtain obtain items with which they can overcome those obstacles such as keys to open gates or upgrades to their movement to be able to climb over walls.
